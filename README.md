# chrome-extension
An extension for the google chrome browser, created by following a simple tutorial. When clicked on the extension's browser icon which appears next to the address bar at the top of the webpage, the extension opens a new tab. In this new tab, the first hyper link listed on the webpage from which the browser icon was clicked is opened. 

To load this extension:
1. Pack all the files into a folder.

2. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:      alt tag and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

3. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

4. Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

5. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

If everything goes well, an icon like ![My image](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png) should get displayed next to the address bar.
